#### Definitions

##### Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
NVC is a process to build stronger relationships by resolving disagreement, negotiation, and conflict. The idea is that everyone can be compassionate and empathetic. We use behavior that harm others only when we do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting our needs or the needs of others.

##### Relationship Escalator

The expectation (and pressure) we have when we are in a romantic relationship - We are suppose to date, than become exclusive, than move in together, have kids, etc.

##### Relationship Anarchy

The idea that each relationship is unique, and we can't compare one relationship to another and can't put labels on it. For example - just because we are dating someone romanticaly, doesn't mean that this relationship is more or less important than a relationship that doesn't have the romantic element in it. We also avoid naming our relationships, so we don't use the term boyfriend, lover, partner etc. Naming your relationship might force you to fit your emotions, thoughs, and actions into the name you gave your relationship but in reality your feelings should have room to change and evolve.

##### Compersion

A positive feeling which a person may sometimes experience when their partner is happily involved with somebody else, in contrast to jealousy.

##### New relationship energy (NRE)
Excitment at the beginning of a new relationship

##### Non-monogamy

Loving more than one person. It can be romantic (polyamory) or sexual (open relationship / swinging)
